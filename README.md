# Weather Trends
Before a big trip I am always refreshing the weather forecast to see what to expect 10+ days out. However, as you know the weather is always changing that far into the forecast.

This little app simply shows me over time how the weather forecast is changing, so I can tell if the weather is trending down or up. I did leverage AI for some of this, so please excuse any obvious errors. It works for what I was trying to achieve.
